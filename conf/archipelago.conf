# (peer role, peer type)
# Mandatory peer roles:
# 	blockerb
# 	blockerm
# 	mapperd
# 	vlmcd
#
# Available peer types:
# 	rados_blocker
# 	file_blocker
# 	mapperd
# 	vlmcd
#

# Generic peer options
# portno_start: Start of port range that will be used by the peer
# portno_end: End of port range that will be used by the peer
# nr_ops: Max number of flying operations. Must be a power of 2.
# log_level: verbosity levels for each xseg peer
#            0 - Error
#            1 - Warnings
#            2 - Info
#            3 - Debug
# Warning: debug level 3 logs A LOT!
# nr_threads: Number of threads of each peer. Currently only blockers supports
# 	      threads with the following tricks:
# 	      a) Threads in file_blocker are I/O threads that block.
# 	      b) Threads in rados_blocker are processing threads. For lock
# 	      congestion reasons, avoid setting them to a value larger than 4.


# file_blocker specific options:
#
# archip_dir: Where archipelago files will reside
# fdcache: Fd cache size

# rados_blocker specific options:
#
# pool: rados pool where objects will reside
