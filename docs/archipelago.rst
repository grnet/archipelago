Problem Overview
================

In an IaaS cloud, VM provisioning and destroying happens continiously and it
should be fast and efficient. In the same time, VMs should be live-migratable
across physical nodes to achieve persistency. So the question boils down to:

How can I deploy VMs from image files in seconds, while in the same time being
able to live-migrate them and do that in a large-scale and stable manner?

As far as we know, no one seems to have completely solved the above problem, at
least not in the open source world. There are some solutions either proprietary
or open source that try to tackle the problem, but all of them seem to have
limitations regarding different aspects of the problems.

Proprietary SAN/NAS solutions
-----------------------------

Proprietary SAN/NAS solutions support live-migration out-of-the-box since the
storage is shared across all physical nodes where VMs live. The most advanced
ones also support thin cloning and snapshotting, meaning they also solve the
'fast' provisioning part. However they have some major problems:

| 1. They are not open
| 2. They are expensive
| 3. They do not scale
| 4. They cause vendor lock-in

Over the network RAID-1: DRBD
-----------------------------

DRBD is a great technology. It is open source, proven, mature and if you
combine it with a sophisticated virtualization manager that can handle it (such
as Google Ganeti) you can also support live VM migrations out-of-the-box, even
in geographically distinct locations. DRBD is also very scalable since it is
completely decentralized. However it has two big problems:

| 1. It does not support thin clones and snapshots
| 2. It cannot be used as a centralized store for files and images

The above mean that it cannot cater for the 'fast' provisioning part and cannot
be easily integrated to act as a backend for files, images or objects.

Open source distributed filesystems
-----------------------------------

Open source distributed filesystems seem to be the way to go in the cloud and
are highly appreciated and praised by many promiment members of the cloud
community. Solutions like Ceph, GlusterFS, MooseFS, ZFS and others are potential
candidates when it comes to backing a large scale cloud service. A distributed
filesystem is visible by all physical nodes hosting VMs, so live-migration is
supported and they can also be used to store files and images. However, such
solutions seem to have problems too, when it comes to deploying in a large
scale critical environmet. The major ones are:

| 1. Stability
| 2. Scalability

Our experience also indicates that a cloud platform doesn't really need
filesystem semantics, but rather block and object interfaces. Thus, a
distributed filesystem adds complexity and overhead to the picture. The Ceph
project seems to be doing a good job towards this direction, but it is still
very early to point it as the possible solution.

Multiple storage technologies
-----------------------------

Since there is no single solution to fit the cloud case, one even more important
problem arises. What happens with legacy hardware, how does one maintain,
upgrade, move from one technology to the other, or even integrate different
storage technologies to cater for different needs in a unified way? And why does
a reliable, redundant, scalable data store has to interfere with cloud
semantics, clones, snapshots, deduplication, block and file interfaces?

The above problems, which were the ones we also bumped on and tried to solve on
our own real-world use case, led us to the design and implementation of
Archipelago.


Archipelago Overview
====================

Archipelago is a distinct storage layer that provides the logic and interfaces
needed to integrate with a cloud platform, while in the same time being
agnostic to the underlying storage technology, which is used to store the
actual data.

In the figure below, we see Archipelago running in a number of physical nodes.
It provides different endpoints for volume access by VMs or file access via
HTTP:

.. image:: images/archipelago-overview.png
    :target: _images/archipelago-overview.png
    :scale: 70

It also provides the corresponding logic for thin volume cloning and
snapshotting independently from the actual storage. Archipelago is deployed on
each node where the volume will be used (e.g.: acting as a VM disk). The volume
is exposed as an independent block device and accessed as such. The data of
each volume can reside on any supported underlying storage type. The software
stack will take care of any coordination or concurrency control needed between
other nodes running Archipelago.

In the same way Archipelago may be deployed on a node that will act as an HTTP
gateway for files. It will then provide the corresponding endpoint and the
deduplication logic to export the data stored on the underlying storage as
files.

Archipelago's goal is to decouple the composition/snapshot/cloning/deduplicating
logic from the storage backend used.  Essentially, provide the necessary layer
where the aforementioned logic and volume handling is implemented and also
implement an interface with pluggable storage drivers, to operate over
different storage types. Finally, export different access endpoints for use by
the upper layers.


Idea
====

Every Volume inside a VM can be thought of as a linearly addressable set of
fixed-size blocks. The storage of the actual blocks is orthogonal to the task of
exposing a single block device for use by each VM. Bridging the gap between the
VMs performing random access to Volumes and the storage of actual blocks is
Archipelago: a custom storage handling layer which handled volumes as set of
distinct blocks in the backend, a process we call volume composition.

For the actual storage of blocks, Archipelago is agnostic to the storage backend
used. Through pluggable storage drivers, Archipelago can support multiple storage
backends to suit the needs of each deployment. We currently provide two storage
drivers. One for simple files, where each object is stored as a single file on the
(shared) filesystem, and one for objects backed by RADOS. RADOS is the
distributed object store which supports the Ceph parallel filesystem. With RADOS,
we can solve the problem of reliable, fault-tolerant object storage through
replication on multiple storage nodes.

As mentioned before, Archipelago composes the volume through individual blocks.
This is accomplished by maintaining a map for each volume, to map offset in a
volume with a single object. The exact offset inside the object, is calculated
statically from the fixed object size and the offset in the volume. But having
this map and the composition subsystems, allow us to do much more than simple
volume composition. Archipelago offers Copy-On-Write snapshottable volumes.
Furthermore, each snapshot can be hashed, to allow deduplication to play its
part, reducing the storage cost of each hashed object. Furthermore, Archipelago
can integrate with Pithos, and use Pithos images to provision a volume with
Copy-On-Write semantics (i.e. a clone). Since Pithos images are already hashed,
we can store Archipelago hashed volumes, which are indistinguishable from a Pithos
image, along with the Pithos images, to enable further deduplication, or even
registering an archipelago hashed snapshot as Pithos image file. The above
process is illustrated on the following figure.

Archipelago is used by Cyclades and Ganeti for fast VM provisioning based on CoW
volumes. Moreover, it enables live migration of thinly-provisioned VMs with no
physically shared storage.


Endpoint and Backend drivers
============================

.. image:: images/archipelago-apis.png
    :target: _images/archipelago-apis.png

Archipelago allows users to manage and access the underlying data, which is
backed by various storage types. In order to do that, Archipelago can provide
multiple endpoints for the user or upper layers to interact. Some of them are:

 * block device driver
 * qemu driver
 * user provided process
 * command line tool
 * http gateway for files

It also implements different drivers to interact with different types of
underlying storage technologies.


Internal Architecture
=====================

.. image:: images/archipelago-architecture.png
    :target: _images/archipelago-architecture.png

Archipelago consists of several components, both userspace and kernelspace,
which communicate through a custom-built shared memory segment communication
mechanism. This mechanism, which is called XSEG, also defines a common
communication protocol between these components and is provided by the library
``libxseg``.  Each Archipelago component, which can be a kernelspace block
driver or a userspace process, is an *xseg peer*.  The segment provides *ports*,
where each peer binds. The peer then uses the port to communicate with the other
peers on the same segment. The communication consists of *requests* that are
submitted to the receiver port, and are responded to the submitter port.

This form of communication, allows us to develop distinct components for each
operation of Archipelago, while being able to communicate with exactly
the same protocol between these components, independently from their domain
(userspace or kernelspace).

Archipelago components
----------------------

Each Archipelago component serves a distinct purpose and coordinates with the
other components to provide the final service.

These components are described below.

Volume composer (vlmcd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Volume composer is responsible for the volume composition. Xsegbd devices direct
I/O requests on the volume, to the volume composer. Volume composer then
consults the mapper, to get the actual objects on which it will perform the
appropriate I/O. It then directs I/O requests for each individual object to the
blocker and wait for their completion. In the end, it composes the individual
responses, to respond to the original volume request from the xsegbd.

Mapper (mapperd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mapper is responsible for keeping and updating the mappings from volume
offsets to individual objects which actually hold the data. It is also
responsible for creating new volumes, snapshotting existing ones and create new
volume based on a previously captured snapshot (clones). It stores the mappings
to the storage backend, from which it reads and/or updates them, keeping them
cached when appropriate. It also ensure that each action on the volumes, does
not happen unless the necessary volume locks are acquired.

File blocker (filed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File blocker is responsible for storing each object as a single file in a
specified directory. It servers the requests for each objects as they come from
the volume composer and the mapper components.

Rados blocker (sosd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rados blocker is another form of blocker which stores each objects as a single
object in a RADOS pool. It can be used instead of the file blocker, to create
and use disks over RADOS storage.

Block devices (xsegbd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each volume on Archipelago is exposed as a block device in the system /dev
directory. These special devices are nothing more than just another peer, which
forwards the requests through the shared memory segment, to the volume composer
for completion.

In a nutshell, in archipelago, each xsegbd device communicates through the
shared memory segment with the volume composer. Then the volume composer
requests the objects on which it should perform the I/O from the mapper. The
mapper takes into account all the necessary logic (taking locks etc) and
retrieves the mappings from the storage, by requesting the appropriate objects
from the blocker responsible to hold the maps. It then performs any copy on
write operations needed and returns the mapping to the volume composer. The
volume composer then communicates with the blocker responsible for holding the
objects where the actual data reside and composes the responses, to respond to
the original request.
